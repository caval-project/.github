## The Classical Armenian Valency Lexicon Project

The DFG-funded **CAVaL** project offers an online platform for the study of Classical Armenian morphosyntax. The platform allows to retrieve corpus-driven data on syntactic, morphological, and lexical properties of predicate-argument structures. The corpus includes of a selection of early Classical Armenian texts annotated according to the *Universal Dependencies* formalism.
